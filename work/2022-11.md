Upcoming Map Changes

Within the next week or two, life services on the map (and family trees) will be significantly changed. For me loading has been significantly faster, but searching capability will be significantly reduced.

Life search will operate In Browser, on the lives which have been loaded, typically for display on the map. This means search will be limited to the server and time range selected, instead of operating across all servers and the entire history.

At the current time, The last eight hours of each daily snapshot will be unavailable. This may be solvable, but I don't want to deal the added complexity right now.

Name searches are now strict substring; the server had used a fuzzy matching method. I hope to make this a little bit fuzzy in the future.

There may be some additional artifacts. Notably, families alive at the start of the query period may appear as separate lineages, since they have no common ancestor loaded.

Why is this happening?

Several months ago, Heroku announced that they were shutting down their free services, with no good low cost alternative. The map server and several of my other projects hosted there were already overdue for maintenance. In the case of the map (and family trees), the real cost has been the life database (hosted elsewhere on AWS), costing me over $20/month. Since I had to change platforms anyway, I decided to reengineer the services to operate without a database to reduce operating costs (and also increase response time for "last few days" cases). Since I begin this work, Heroku announced a more reasonable low cost plan, but I had long been pondering what it would take to remove the database cost.

Why those eight hours? (technobabble)

I was already switching to a static file system, so almost on a lark I made a raw logfile viewer has a hedge against future technology disruptions like this. It ended up working better than expected and I've rolled with it. The logs are broken into files on UTC days, which allows direct addressing by filename. However, they are published eight hours later resulting in a partial day's log file. Past that one day, the log files never change, so I expect to serve them with long cache expiration times. However, if I served the partial files, they would be cached in their incomplete state, perhaps for a very long time. For now, the partial files not being made available at all.





Upcoming Family Tree Changes

Within the next week or two, life services on the family trees (and map) will be significantly changed. This work is not quite complete. So far I've been able to render much larger trees, but searching capability will be significantly reduced.

The site may change url (TBD).

Tree links (parameters) generated by the old trees/maps will no longer work. I may put in a heuristic for the common case of recent bigserver2 families. Eve links generated by the official family trees site should continue to work. (Aside from the possible url change, for which I may be able to make a redirect.)
